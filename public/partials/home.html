                Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at Regis University. I research global media, human rights and press freedom. I earned a B.A. in Journalism from the University of Colorado at Boulder, an M.A. in International and Intercultural Communication from the University of Denver and a Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have worked with anti-human trafficking organizations in the United States and Thailand as well as the United States Department of State in Malawi. I am a Colorado native. I love to travel and am a cupcake enthusiast (and a certified cake decorator!).
